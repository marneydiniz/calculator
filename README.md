# calculator

This is my project to create a Calculator.

I used the Observer design pattern to monitor the events shown on the calculator's Display.

To record the event related to button clicks, the ActionListenner interface was used.

The graphic interface was produced using Java Swing and inspired by the MacOS calculator.
